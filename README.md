# LinfomaClassification

This repository contains scripts to train and evaluate Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) using pre-trained models such as MobileNetV2, ResNet50, VGG16, and InceptionV3. The scripts are designed to iterate over various input image sizes, evaluate model performance, and measure inference time.
